# Reknamorcen

### Starting
To start just run file main.py using a python 3 interpreter

### Useful commands
To display possible commands type "cinfo" anytime. This should show you other commands you can use while playing.

### About
This is a small fantasy game done in python console. The only possible language now is czech.
This is to be changed hopefully. The actual version has just a few features and lacks even a proper introduction.
It's supposed to be just a test of the actual features.
